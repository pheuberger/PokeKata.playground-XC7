# PokeKata.playground-XC7
PokemonKata in Swift 2.2

## Important
Make sure to remove the `-XC7` part from the folder name when checking it out. Otherwise XCode will not recognize the project as a playground.

## Task
Make the test pass by implementing code that finds the Pokemon that's nearest to the player location and is a normal Pokemon.
Hint: It's Mewtwo.

## Constraints
Don't use `for`, `forEach`, `while` or any other classical loop concept. Also don't bridge arrays over to Objective-C.
The idea is to use **functional concepts** to solve this problem.
